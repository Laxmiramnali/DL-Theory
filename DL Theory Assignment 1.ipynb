It is a binary linear threshold model, where a neuron's output is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the total input to the neuron is above or below a certain threshold. It consists of a linear summation of weighted input signals and an activation function. The model was one of the earliest attempts to describe how a neuron works, and is still used as a basic model for understanding the behavior of neurons in a network."

It is composed of a single layer of neurons, each with a single output, and weights are adjusted based on a learning algorithm. The output of the network is a weighted sum of the inputs, with the weights determined by a learning algorithm. The weights are adjusted such that the output of the network is as close as possible to the desired output. The ADALINE model is used in a variety of applications, including pattern recognition, image processing, and robotics."
